About 

## NATURAL PERFUMERY 

>
 I create natural fragrances, using distilled plant and flower essences that I collect from around the world. The sights, tastes, and smells of an early childhood spent in Indonesia as a child and my travels around the Earth throughout adulthood inspires all the scents that I lovingly brew in my home. In my experience, it is the scent of natural flora and herbs that most vividly transports ones consciousness to those certain magical moments in life. 
 
## HANDMADE ACCESSORIES 

>
 The intricate silk floral "kanzashi" worn by geishas, maiko, and cherry blossom festival enthusiasts alike in Japan. The floral "hiasan" crowns and streams of jasmine worn by brides and dancers in Java and Bali. Herbal wax headpieces worn by Ancient Egyptian women, which released fragrances of frankincense and myrrh as they melted into the hair under the hot sun. There is both a universiality and a sense of history in the allure of these specially crafted accessories. 
>
 My handmade silk and floral ornaments are designed to be accompanied by my fragrances, or worn alone. Originally influenced by the cultural flavors and intimacies of world dances, it is my goal to bring these traditional crafts into a modern context and create specially made ornaments that smell of freshly cut bouquets or bring fond memories of our journeys through nature.
