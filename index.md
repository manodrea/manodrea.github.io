NATURAL PERFUMERY
 I create natural fragrances, using distilled plant and flower essences sourced from around the world. The sights, tastes, and smells that I experienced growing up in Indonesia as a child and the experience travelling around the globe throughout life provides inspiration for the scents that I lovingly brew in my home. In my experience, it is the scent of natural flora and herbs that most vividly transports ones consciousness to those certain magical moments in life.

 I strive to create fragrances that convey the most unique experiences and free from parabens, petrochemicals, glycols, and harmful synthetic chemicals. 
 
HANDMADE ACCESORIES 
 The intricate silk floral "kanzashi" worn by geishas, maiko, and cherry blossom festival enthusiasts alike in Japan. The floral "hiasan" crowns and streams of jasmine worn by brides and dancers in Java and Bali. Herbal wax headpieces worn by Ancient Egyptian women, which released fragrances of frankincense and myrrh as they melted into the hair under the hot sun. There is both a universiality and a sense of history in the allure of these specially crafted accessories. 

 I craft handmade silk and floral ornaments that are designed to be accompanied by my fragrances, or worn alone. Originally influenced by the cultural flavors and intimacies of world dances, it is my goal to bring these traditional crafts into a modern context and create specially made ornaments that smell of freshly cut bouquets or bring fond memories of our journeys through nature.
