![](/img/Jasmincense.jpg) 



Description : Jasmincense is a botanical perfume, whose notes are primarily based on the marriage of Jasmine Grandiflorium and Frankincense. Jasmine flowers in bloom are sultry, rich, and nocturnal. Frankincense is spiritual, serene, and diurnal. The result is a soft and calming sensation, suitable for meditation in the day or relaxation at night. 

Jasmincense is completely botanical and alchohol-free, featuring jojoba oil that locks moisture in the skin without leaving a single trace of residue. All ingredients are completely natural, no synthetics.


Personal Note : This one is quite special to me and I use this on myself for relaxing or meditative activities. For this piece of my collection, I use top grade green hojari sacred frankincense that is ground and treated by my own hand.
