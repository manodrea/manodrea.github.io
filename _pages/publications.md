ORIGIN STORY
> My initial delve into the study of natural oils and bespoke perfumery are inspired by my experiences in Argentine tango and experiencing a plethora of the natural and perfumed smells of men and women dancing at dusk together in the ronda (a circular line of dance by which people dance tango socially in milongas, or tango venues originating in Buenos Aires). 

> My accessories collection is also inspired by my experiences of growing up in Indonesia and studying the traditional dances of Central Java and Bali. I was fascinated with the tradition of dancers wearing elaborately fragrant flowers and hiasan in their hair, accompanied by skilled musicians wearing batik caps scented of local sandalwood and patchouli. I also had the opportunity to experience authentic Japanese tea ceremony in the courtyards of the Edo-period Nagoya castle. The graceful silk kanzashi, which are hanging floral head pieces that accessorize traditional Japanese garments, lent to me and worn by the hosts left a strong impression.

 > My handmade silk and floral ornaments are designed to be accompanied by my fragrances, or worn alone. Originally influenced by the cultural flavors and intimacies of world dances, it is my goal to bring these traditional crafts into a modern context and create specially made ornaments that smell of freshly cut bouquets or bring fond memories of our journeys through nature.
