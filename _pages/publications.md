> My initial delve into the study of natural oils and bespoke perfumery was influenced by my experiences in Argentine tango and experiencing a plethora of the natural and perfumed smells of men and women dancing at dusk together in the ronda (a circular line of dance by which people dance tango socially in milongas, a style of venue that originated in Buenos Aires). While dancing in a very close embrace, I was intrigued by the diversity of personal scent and that no fragrance smells exactly alike on any particular person. Here, I strive to create botanical-based fragrances that convey the most unique experiences and as natural as possible: free from parabens, petrochemicals, glycols, or harmful synthetic chemicals.

> My collection of handmade accessories is inspired by my experiences of growing up in Indonesia and studying the traditional dances of Central Java and Bali from an early age. As a dancer, I was fascinated with the tradition of donning elaborately fragrant flowers and "hiasan" hair ornaments. Dances were accompanied by skilled musicians that wore batik caps scented of local sandalwood and patchouli. In addition, I was inspired by the tradition of Japanese tea ceremony from my time in the courtyards of an Edo-period castle in Nagoya. The grace of the silk kanzashi, hanging floral ornaments that traditionally accesorize the Japanese kimono, lent to me and worn by the hosts left a strong impression.


> My handmade silk and floral ornaments are designed to be accompanied by my fragrances, or worn alone. Originally influenced by the intimacies of world dance, travel, and theatre: it is my goal to bring these traditional crafts into a modern context and create special ornaments that smell of freshly cut bouquets or bring forth fond memories of our journeys celebrating the natural world.
