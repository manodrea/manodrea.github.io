ORIGIN STORY
>
My initial delve into the study of natural oils and bespoke perfumery are inspired by my experiences in Argentine tango and experiencing a plethora of the natural and perfumed smells of men and women dancing at dusk together in the ronda (a circular line of dance by which people dance tango socially in milongas, or tango venues originating in Buenos Aires). My inspiration to create fragrant Kanzashi comes from both my experience wearing Kanzashi and performing Japanese tea ceremony in the courtyards of Edo-period castles. My project is also inspired by my experiences of growing up in Indonesia and studying the traditional dances of Central Java and Bali. I was fascinated with the tradition of dancers wearing elaborately fragrant flowers and hiasan in their hair, accompanied by skilled musicians wearing batik caps scented of local sandalwood and patchouli.
