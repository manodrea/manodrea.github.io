> Blog : In development!

> I am pretty reluctant to make videos, however I do quite like the idea of using this platform to start a blog. I am particularly interested in botanical and perfume history so I plan to create a series of entries that I call "Ode to a Note". Each entry will explore a little history of a botanical note with a little personal commentary.
