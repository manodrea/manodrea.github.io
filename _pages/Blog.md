> Blog : In development!

>I am pretty shy when it comes to videos, but I do quite like the idea of using this platform to start a blog. I am particularly interested in botanical and perfume history so I plan to create a series of entries that I call "Ode to a Note". Each entry will explore a little history of a botanical note with a little personal commentary. 

> Note: Comments are welcome and encouraged, but I personally highly value internet etiquette and this site is my domain. Only positivity, inquiry, or constructive criticism please.
