"Love is wiser than Philosophy, though he is wise, and mightier than Power, though he is mighty... His lips are sweet as honey and his breath is like frankincense." - Oscar Wilde, The Happy Prince

Frankincense is a resin harvested from the bark of Boswellia trees, historically used as incense as far back as the ancient Middle East. Most commonly produced in Africa and Saudi Arabia to this day, farmers create incisions in Boswellia trees and collect the crystallized matter in the form of what are called resin tears. The method of farming has largely stayed the same. In Somalia, for example, very tiny piece of resin is painstakingly harvested from bark and sorted by hand.

It was a most highly valued commodity since early civilization, popularly known for being mentioned in the Bible as one of the gifts offered to Jesus by the three wise kings. Dating back to well before that time, by about four thousand years, frankincense was believed by ancient Egyptians to indicate the presence of the gods. Extensive and grueling trade routes and expansions of western civilization were motivated by the search and trade of frankincense and myrrh. In ancient Greece, these tears were offered as one of the most extravagant gift to the gods and to Apollo in particular. Notably, the polymath Pythagoras was recorded to offer fumigations of frankincense as a priest of Apollo. In modern religions, it is known to be used extensively by the catholic church.

And perhaps the universial recognition of this resin as calming incense and mild consciousness altering substance is not without scientific validity. In 2008, researchers at John Hopkins University investigated frankincense as a potential natural anti-depressive substance. They found that a major component (incensole acetate) stimulated a specific ion receptor in the central nervous system associated with the perception of warmth on the skin and vasoregulation. However, it is also important to note that well-designed human clinical trials have not been done on frankincense (which is oddly true for many other natural products). Though a select few researchers continue to explore this area, the extent of these effects on humans and an observable mechanism of action is still a mystery.

The scent of natural frankincense is both light and complex, slightly sweet and very softly reminiscent of pine. There are about different varieties of frankincense. Thirteen well known species of the Boswellia tree, but only a portion of those are viable from which to harvest this resin. Not to mention, there are vastly different qualities of resin depending on purity, farming region, and contamination with boswellian wood. My favorite is the classic green hojari or "sacred frankincense", originating mostly in Oman from the species <em> Boswellia Sacra </em> . Frankincense oil is sold commonly but the quality is often suspect and are often sold by exploitative multi-level-marketing corporations that prey on the lack of knowledge of others. For that reason, I have always enjoy sourcing it directly on my own and grinding my own resins by hand. One of my botanical perfumes, which I decided to fondly name <em> Jasmincense </em>, features an extensive amount of hojari that I process with my own hands.

When I am working closely with it at high concentrations, I tend to sense an extremely mild and relaxed body high similar to that experienced with CBD, and the slightest increase in heart rate (similar to standing up after sitting for a long time). Of course I am certainly not making any broad claims about any health effects and everyone's personal experience with certain fragrances and other substances can be quite different. But it is certainly an interesting sensation that I don't experience when working with other materials. As for me, I also view frankincense as a serene and diurnal fragrance and most fitting for use in the daytime. It seems a fitting resin to have a history associated with the greek god of the sun - not a blazing fire, but rather a like a soft and spiritual hearth. Like certain forms of classical music, the scent tends to put me in a state of heightened mental clarity and relaxation. 

Other notes : 

- Today, the Roman Catholic church uses an approximate 50 metric tons of frankincense per year

- Historians estimate that 300 tons of incense per year were carried on the backs of camels across the dessert routes connecting across Saudi Arabia, Iran, Ethopia at the height of its use as a luxury in ancient times  (as well as across the sea to India)

- Global fair trade and labor policies as well as sustainable innovations in Boswellia farming will be necessary in the near future if we are to continue consuming this precious resource. I recommend this article: https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2019/12/frankincense-trees-declining-overtapping/ however it also features DoTerra representatives, and I consider DoTerra's MLM-like business model to be rather unscrupulous.
