"Love is wiser than Philosophy, though he is wise, and mightier than Power, though he is mighty... His lips are sweet as honey and his breath is like frankincense." - Oscar Wilde, The Happy Prince

Frankincense is a resin harvested from the bark of Boswellia trees, historically used as incense as far back as the ancient Middle East. Most commonly produced in Africa and Saudi Arabia to this day, farmers create incisions in Boswellia trees and collect the crystallized matter in the form of what are called resin tears.

It was a most highly valued commodity since early civilization, popularly known for being mentioned in the Bible as one of the gifts offered to Jesus by the three wise kings. Dating back to well before that time, frankincense was believed by ancient Egyptians to indicate the presence of the gods. In ancient Greece, the tears were offered as one of the most extravagant gift to the gods and to Apollo in particular. Notably, the polymath Pythagoras was recorded to offer fumigations of frankincense as a priest of Apollo. In modern religions, it is known to be used extensively by the catholic church.

And perhaps the universial recognition of this resin as calming incense and mild consciousness altering substance is not without scientific validity. In 2008, researchers at John Hopkins University investigated frankincense as a potential natural anti-depressive substance. They found that a major component (incensole acetate) stimulated a specific ion receptor in the central nervous system associated with the perception of warmth on the skin and vasoregulation. However, it is also important to note that well-designed human clinical trials have not been done on frankincense (which is oddly true for many other natural products). Though a select few researchers continue to explore this area, the extent of these effects on humans and an observable mechanism of action is still a mystery.

The scent of natural frankincense is both light and complex, slightly sweet and very softly reminiscent of pine. There are about thirteen varieties of frankincense (corresponding to thirteen well known species of the Boswellia tree). Not to mention, there are vastly different qualities of resin depending on purity, farming region, and contamination with boswellian wood. My favorite is the classic green hojari or "sacred frankincense", originating mostly in Oman from the species <em> Boswellia Sacra </em> . Frankincense oil is sold commonly but the quality is often suspect and are often sold by exploitative multi-level-marketing corporations that prey on the lack of knowledge of others. For that reason, I have always njoy sourcing it directly on my own and grinding my own resins by hand. One of my botanical perfumes, which I decided to fondly name <em> Jasmincense </em>, features an extensive amount of hojari that I process with my own hands.
