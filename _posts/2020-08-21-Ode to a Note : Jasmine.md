<em> "Twas midnight through the lattice wreath'd
With woodbine, many a perfume breath'd
From plants that wake when others sleep, 
From timid jasmine buds, that keep their odour to themselves all day,
But, when sunlight dies away let the delicious secret out 
To every breeze that roams about." <br> - Thomas Moore, Lalla Rookh </em>

Jasmine flower, the queen of fragrant flowers, certainly needs no introduction when it comes to discussing botanical fragrances. There are 200 species of jasmine. The most cultivated are Jasminium grandiflorium, sambac, auriculatum, and multiflorum, which are used for food, tea, and fragrance. Jasminium sambac is the one that brings, to my mind, memories of the heady and tropical scent of the evening from growing up in Indonesia. As a child, I learned traditional Indonesian performance at a dance school in Yogyakarta. A sacred dance that I learned carefully from an elderly master and eventually performed was one meant to signify my coming of age by demonstrating competency in graceful and feminine movements that were of greater complexity than those taught prior. Given the revered national status of jasmine in Indonesia since ancient times, it should be no surprise that the dance was named after and modeled after the night-blooming jasmine flower.

As a symbol of life, beauty, and union, t﻿he jasmine flower plays a large role in a plethora of Indonesian traditions. In some cases, such as in traditional Balinese funerals, it is associated with spirits and with death. In Indonesian patriotic songs, fallen jasmine often hailed as the representation of heroes that died for the country, perhaps analogous to the association of fallen sakura flowers with honoring fallen heroes as in old Japanese traditions.

I have just summarized the flower’s relationship to Indonesia, which is reflective of my cultural influences, but jasmine has an important cultural role since ancient times and across the globe - particularly India, the Middle East, China, and South East Asia. Not only do the species of jasmine vary in scent to one another, there can be vastly different qualities depending with high sensitivity on the region, farming conditions, and even precisely the developmental stage at which the flower is plucked. Jasmine only surrender their fragrance during full bloom, which typically lasts for twelve hours before senesce. Senesced flowers, closed buds, bruised petals, and buds that fail to bloom after being plucked rendered useless for extraction. Luckily, there has been much scientific work toward understanding the blooming patterns and in improving the yield of processed condensates [1]. For example recent studies on Jasminium sambac have documented exactly how the profile of molecule emission changes hourly during the blooming period and determined eight hours post-excision to be the most optimal for extraction [2]. The global scale demand for jasmine combined with the complication and laborious nature of gardening, blooming, harvest and extraction (on top of the fact that it requires approximately 2000 pounds of jasmine to produce just one pound of oil) offers explanation as to why these culturally revered flowers are so expensive and precious.

The scent of jasmine itself is inimitable. Using laboratory analysis, the most prominent aromatic molecules (such as indole, linalool, alpha-fernese, etc.) and exactly how that profile varies across species-to-species and region-to-region can be elucidated [3,4,5,6].  But if you have ever tried smelling these compounds individually, it can be really hard to see how it stacks up. The imitation fragrance oils produced by multiple corporations so far, with well-funded laboratories and the most capable scientists in employment, still do not come close to natural jasmine. It is as though the complexity of jasmine is an emergent property, or rather that the whole of the natural scent profile is greater than the sum of its parts. 

While there are a few groups more recently conducting research on the potential neuropsychological or calming effects of jasmine [7,8], I feel that it is important to note that there is little evidence from peer reviewed academic or biomedical research on regarding consistent and tangible health benefits beyond the improvement of mood. That may surprise some, considering how many extensive claims are made that jasmine treats a variety of diseases and disorders. For example, jasmine is historically used in Ayurvedic medicine to reduce post-partum lactation and published studies in India claimed that it performed comparably to the gold standard drug (bromocriptine) but these studies were of poor quality [9]. Hence, I would really advise anyone to be skeptical regarding such claims. The push to sell essential oils for that purpose is largely unnecessary, at best. The beautiful and mysterious fragrance of jasmine flower, with a rich cultural history and complex cultivation process, can be appreciated for that reason alone.
